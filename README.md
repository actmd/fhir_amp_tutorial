# FHIR AMP Tutorial

This is a guide for creating a simple application that can let you extract and display Allergies, Medications and Problems (Conditions) from a FHIR server.

We are going to be using the following stack for demonstration purposes
    * (Epic FHIR Resources)[https://open.epic.com/Interface/FHIR] 
    * (Python Flask)[http://flask.pocoo.org/] - a very decent micro-framework

# Setup
 
Login to the Epic open api (so you can access the sandbox)

Fork this, and run on heroku.

# What the app does

It connects to the demo epic instance, and 

* retrieves a patient list
* for each patient you can see their allergies, medications, and conditions
